# Simple-Unix-Shell in C
•	Developed a shell in C that accepts user commands and executes them as a separate process.
•	Used fork() and exec() system calls to create a child process and execute any Unix command.
•	Implemented internal commands such as pwd, cd, exit and history; handled the SIGINT signal to display history.
